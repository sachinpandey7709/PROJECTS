            As of 09.06.2024, Samsung is no longer filtering repetitive MACs,

            That doesn't help us, because spoofing becomes clearly useless,
            and the 'SPAM' becomes more like a one-time popup (maybe few if someone is turning the screen on/off frequently).
            I believe on some phones it may still work like usual, especially the older/ not updated ones.
